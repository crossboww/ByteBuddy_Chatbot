As new discoveries are made, our understanding of the universe and its planetary populations will continue to evolve."}, {"role": "user", "content": "no, i am asking about earth , jupter, pluto n all"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're asking about the number of planets in our own solar system.\n\nThere are 8 planets in our solar system:\n\n1.
